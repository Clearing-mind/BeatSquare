# Scale
This github contains (almost) all the assets used in the Powerrangers game, made for the Game Off 2023. The game was made within the Unity Game Engine.
All the other assets are custom made for this project, are unlicenced and free to use.

In this game, players can control character movement, and they can only attack enemies on the beat.

You can find the game at: https://powerrangers.itch.io/beat-square
