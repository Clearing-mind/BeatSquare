# Scale
This github contains (almost) all the assets used in the Powerrangers game, made for the Game Off 2023. The game was made within the Unity Game Engine.
All the other assets are custom made for this project, are unlicenced and free to use.

Compared to classic rhythm games, in this game, players can control character movement, and are encouraged to move, jump, and attack following the beat.

You can find the game at: https://powerrangers.itch.io/beat-square
