# Scale
This github contains (almost) all the assets used in the Powerrangers game, made for the Game Off 2023. The game was made within the Unity Game Engine.
All the other assets are custom made for this project, are unlicenced and free to use.

This is a game where you run to collect music fragments. When you act on the beat, you will be bonored an ability to change the body size, which helps you collect fragments more efficiently.

You can find the game at: https://power-rangers.itch.io/beat-square
